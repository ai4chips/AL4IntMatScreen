1. XenonPy_descriptors_generation.py

You can utilize this code to generate composition descriptors and structure descriptors for materials within the XenonPy toolkit. The input required is the mp-id of the material from the Materials Project (MP) database.

2. ./Input/material_id.csv

The file contains all the material mp-ids involved in the operations described in the paper.

3. ./Output/P_Descriptor.csv

The intermediate file contains material information obtainable from the MP database, where the 'Structure' item will be used for generating structure descriptors in subsequent steps.

4. ./Output/X_Com_Descriptor.csv

XenonPy composition descriptor

5. /Output/X_Str_Descriptor.csv

XenonPy structure descriptor
