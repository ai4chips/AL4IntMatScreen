1.  Inside the main folder, there are seven subfolders named after machine learning algorithms: GPR (Gaussian Process Regression), LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), LR (Linear Regression), RFR (Random Forest Regression), MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), Ridge (Ridge Regression), and SVM (Support Vector Machine). Each of these algorithm-specific folders contains two additional subfolders:

	GPR 

		Cohesive_energy

			Contains the process and results of optimizing the GPR model's hyperparameters for predicting the cohesive energy of 				materials.


		res_lambda

			Contains the process and results of optimizing the GPR model's hyperparameters for predicting the ρλ of materials.

	LASSO 
		Cohesive_energy

				Contains the process and results of optimizing the LASSO model's hyperparameters for predicting the cohesive energy.
		res_lambda

				Contains the process and results of optimizing the LASSO model's hyperparameters for predicting ρλ.

2.  Inside the RFR/res_lambda/ folder, we have provided the optimal parameters that were identified during the hyperparameter optimization process. These parameters enable you to reproduce the model that achieved the best performance in predicting ρλ at this stage of our study.

3.  Inside the SVM/Cohesive_energy/folder, we have provided the optimal parameters that were identified during the hyperparameter optimization process. These parameters enable you to reproduce the model that achieved the best performance in predicting ρλ at this stage of our study.
